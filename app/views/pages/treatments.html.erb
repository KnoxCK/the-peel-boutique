				<h3>WHY PEELS?<br>THE SCIENCE BEHIND SKIN PEELS</h3>
				<p>Skin peels need to be scientifically correct, non-toxix and correctly formulated to maximally rejuvenate the skin. The Peel Boutique offers professional strength lactic acid peels that are chirally correct and non-inflammatory or skin thinning. As we age, all of our tissues thin and inflammation is one of the major factors for causing aging and disease.
				<br></br>
				When it comes to choosing the right peel, you ideally need one that does not contribute to inflammation or challenge your organ function. Rather incredibly, yout body's cell structure will have an anti-aging, healthy response to chirally correct ingredients, allowing them to penetreate into the epidermis, dermis and all cells. This results in visibly firmer, lifted, more youthful looking skin that will help shield against visible aging and skin damage.
				<br></br>
				BBy choosing a chirally correct acid peel at The Peel Boutique, you are nourishing and supporting the skin's cellular structures, stimulating cell renewal and preserving, sustaining and revitalizing skin health.</p>
