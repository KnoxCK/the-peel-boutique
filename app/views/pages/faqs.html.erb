		<h3>FAQs</h3>
		<p><strong>How is Lactic Acid different to Glycolic Acid?</strong>
		<br></br>
		Depending on the strength of glycolic acid, it can quite literally strip the skin and leave it irritated. The Peel Boutique uses Lactic Acid, which won’t make your skin suddenly shred like a snake’s skin. This is a far less invasive and chirally correct peel that still achieves maximum results without any side affects.</p>
		<p><strong>Who will be performing the Peel?</strong>
		<br></br>
		Dr Malik has personally sourced and trained therapists to perform her peels at The Peel Boutique.</p>
		<p><strong>How often should I get a peel at The Peel Boutique?</strong>
		<br></br>
		It is recommended to book in for a monthly peel. With problem skin types, such as acne, twice monthly can be very beneficial.</p>
		<p><strong>Will it hurt?</strong>
		<br></br>
		No, there is no pain - some patients experience a slight tingling sensation.</p>
		<p><strong>Are the results instant? How long will the results last?</strong>
		<br></br>
		Patients often remark how smooth and incredibly soft their skin feels straight after a peel. Makeup also goes on more ‘smoothly’ post treatment due to the resurfacing nature of skin peels. You should see noticeable differences over the course of 24 hours – your skin will appear brighter and more radiant. It is advised to book in for monthly peels to maintain your brighter complexion.</p>
		<p><strong>How should I care for my skin after a peel at The Peel Boutique?</strong>
		<br></br>
		To maintain your new glow, it is advised to use a daily serum from the TPB product range, or as advised by your TPB therapist, and a gentle exfoliant once or twice weekly.</p>
		<p><strong>Can I wear makeup after a peel at The Peel Boutique?</strong>
		<br></br>
		Yes, it is quite safe to apply makeup after a peel. We recommend mineral makeup and oxygenetix is our makeup brand of choice.</p>
		<p><strong>Can I go straight out into the sun after a peel at The Peel Boutique?</strong>
		<br></br>
		Your therapist will apply a layer of sunscreen so it is safe to go out in the sunlight. However, sunbathing is not recommended for 48 hours after a peel. </p>
