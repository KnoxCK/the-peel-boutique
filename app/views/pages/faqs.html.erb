				<p>Depending on the strength of glycolic acid, it can quite literally strip the skin and leave it irritated. The Peel Boutique uses Lactic Acid, which won’t make your skin suddenly shred like a snake’s skin. This is a far less invasive and chirally correct peel that still achieves maximal results with no downtime.</p>

				<p>Clients often remark how smooth and incredibly soft their skin feels straight after a peel. Makeup also goes on more ‘smoothly’ post treatment due to the resurfacing nature of skin peels. You should see noticeable differences over the course of 24 hours – your skin will appear brighter and more radiant. It is advised to book in for monthly peels to maintain your brighter complexion.</p>
